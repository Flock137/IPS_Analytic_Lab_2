Analysis Questions:
1. How does increasing the Young’s Modulus (stiffer material) affect the beam's deformation?
2. What impact does increasing the applied force have on the stress and deformation?
3. Compare the deformation of the beam when using Carbon Fiber versus Plastic. Which
material deforms less, and why?
4. How does changing the beam's thickness or width influence the stress distribution and
overall structural behavior?

We may change these variables to answer to the questions above: 
- Material selection: Switch between Carbon Fiber, Aluminum, and Plastic by
changing the material definition in the code.
- Applied force: Modify the force value to simulate different loading
conditions.
- Beam dimensions: Adjust the length, width, and thickness to explore how
design changes affect stress and deformation.
