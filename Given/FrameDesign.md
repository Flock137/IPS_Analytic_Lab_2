Analysis Questions:
1. Frame Type Comparison:
o How does the X-frame compare to the H-frame in terms of deformation under the
same applied forces? Which configuration appears to be more stable, and why?
2. Effect of Motor Force:
o What happens to the deformation of the frame when you increase the motor force?
At what point do you think the structural integrity of the frame could be
compromised?
3. Impact of Frame Dimensions:
o How do changes in the arm length or width of the frame impact the load distribution
and deformation? Which design choices minimize deformation while maintaining
structural strength?
4. Design Recommendation:
o Based on your observations, which frame type and dimensions would you
recommend for a quadcopter design that prioritizes stability and minimal
deformation? Explain your reasoning using the results from the simulations

We may modify the following variables in the script to observe their effect on the
frame's structural behavior:
▪ Frame Type: Switch between 'X-frame' and 'H-frame' by adjusting the
frame_type variable.
▪ Motor Force: Modify the motor_force variable to simulate different thrust
levels.
▪ Frame Dimensions: Adjust the arm_length and width to explore how
changes in frame design affect deformation.
